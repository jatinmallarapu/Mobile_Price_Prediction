# Mobile_Price_Prediction

## Project Overview:

## Aim: 
The project focuses on building a classification model to predict mobile phone prices based on specific specifications.

## Models Used:

### 1)Logistic Regression: 
Employed for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification.

### 2)Support Vector Machine (SVM):
#### i)Kernel 'Linear': 
Utilized for linearly separable data, achieving high accuracy of 97.2%.
#### ii)Kernel 'RBF': 
Applied for non-linear relationships, contributing to the comprehensive analysis.

### 3)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Configured with k=3 and leaf size=25 for effective classification.
Visualized using decision regions for better understanding.

## Daily Scenario Application:
This project aids an entrepreneur entering the mobile market. By predicting price ranges, it facilitates informed decision-making, enabling competitive pricing against industry giants like Apple and Samsung.

## Conclusion:
The SVM model with a linear kernel exhibits the highest accuracy (97.2%), making it the recommended choice. In daily scenarios, this predictive tool empowers businesses to strategize pricing effectively, enhancing competitiveness in the dynamic mobile phone market.
